# Real-time License Plate Recognition System with YOLOv8 and Flask

## Overview

This project implements a real-time license plate recognition system using YOLOv8 for object detection and Flask for creating a web-based interface. The system is designed to detect license plates in real-time video streams and display the results on a user-friendly web application.

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Integration:** Utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model for accurate and efficient license plate detection.
- **Real-time Processing:** Provides real-time license plate recognition capabilities for live video streams.
- **Web-based Interface:** Uses Flask, a Python web framework, to create a user interface for interacting with the system.
- **Easy Deployment:** The project is designed for easy deployment, making it accessible for a wide range of applications.
